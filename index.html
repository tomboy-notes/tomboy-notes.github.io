<p>Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux, Unix and Mac. Its very simple and easy to use, with the potential to help you organise ideas and information you deal with every day.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a website you wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting or remember an idea about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial Australia? Or are you one of the those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or not-quite-perfect notes systems?</p>

<p>Time for Tomboy. We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application can make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.</p>
